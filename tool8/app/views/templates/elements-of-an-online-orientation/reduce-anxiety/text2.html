                    <p class="comment">Looking back to when I started I did feel anxious about starting on the course, about finding out what was expected of me. Was I going to be able to live up to the standards that I set for myself as well as the ones that others expected of me as well. It was hard to find a middle ground where you are comfortable, but it is good now I really do enjoy it. I just had to find out what was expected of me, and to be kind to myself in terms of meeting my own standards.</p>

                    <p class="comment">At the start of the year I didn't know what to expect to be honest with you because it was completely new to me and it was completely different from what I did expect it felt like being dropped in at the deep end, but now it doesn't even seem that big a deal any more you know.  I've been out of school for so long that I was worried that I would stick out like a sore thumb but it was grand I was worrying about nothing. I just needed to make a plan and do the work. It all worked out.</p>
