            My  first assignment was daunting, I had to write a  1000 word essay in MS Word and send it in online to the virtual learning environment. To do this I needed to be able to type in Word and format the text correctly, save and make backups of my work as I went along. When finished I had to upload my file to the VLE which is like attaching a file to an email.  I checked the college website for tutorials on how to do this and found there were a couple available which really helped.  My top tips for you would be to leave plenty of time if you are unused to typing and backup everything either by saving to a memory stick or emailing the work to yourself.  Also check if there is a computer centre (link) on hand to assist you with any difficulties you may run into while computing.
