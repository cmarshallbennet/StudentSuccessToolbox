                                        Keep an <strong>organised set of notes</strong>. Keep organised folders or notepads, or files on your computer for the 
                                        modules you are taking, for as long as you are here and beyond. Of course this implies that you should
                                        be taking notes. This is very important. When you are reading materials or in tutorials you should be 
                                        taking your own notes, otherwise you run the risk of coming back to handouts or learning materials and 
                                        not remembering what they meant. If you are reading something you shouldnâ€™t just read it and assume that
                                        you have now absorbed that material, because you may come back later and find that you have to re-read it 
                                        again, you should take notes about what you are reading and keep those organised. This will save you a lot 
                                        of time later on when you need to revise.
