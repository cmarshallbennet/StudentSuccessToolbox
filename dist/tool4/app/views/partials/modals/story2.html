            For my <strong>first task</strong> I had to find an article online.  To be honest, I wasn’t sure how I was going to do this.  First I used Google and typed the title of the article into the <strong>search</strong> box and read through the results. I didn’t find the article I needed so I logged on to the <strong>library</strong> (Insert link) entering my <strong>username and password</strong> to gain access to the database.  I had a little trouble finding the article so emailed the <strong>library helpdesk</strong> for advice.</p>  <p>If I could give you <strong>one tip</strong> it would be to <strong>take notes</strong> as you read your articles it will save you time when you are writing your assignments and <strong>never be afraid to ask</strong> the library staff for help!
