            For my first task I had to find an article online.  To be honest, I wasn’t sure how I was going to do this.  First I used Google and typed the title of the article into the search box and read through the results. I didn’t find the article I needed so I logged on to the library (link) entering my username and password to gain access to the database.  I had a little trouble finding the article so emailed the library helpdesk for advice.  If I could give you one tip it would be to take notes as you read your articles it will save you time when you are writing your assignments and never be afraid to ask the library staff for help!
