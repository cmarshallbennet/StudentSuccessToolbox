            <p>When I started my course I got a <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> that allows me to log on to 
                the services provided by the college on and off campus.  I can log on to the <strong>library</strong>
            (Insert link to library of specific institution) and view my 
            library account.  I can also access the <strong>Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)</strong> 
            and can look up what reading material is required for the course.  
            I can send messages to fellow students and to tutors while logged on and I am 
            kept up to date with what’s happening.  The college also provided me with an 
            email address that is linked directly to my student number.  
            If I run into any difficulty with my username & password or 
            email address I contact <strong>the computer centre</strong> and they sort it out for me. </p>
            <p>I will give you a tip…. Always remember to log off from your student 
            account and your email whenever you stop working on a computer, you must keep 
            your <strong>passwords safe</strong> and do not give them to anyone!</p>
