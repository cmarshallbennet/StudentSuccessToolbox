            <p>One of my first <strong>assignments</strong> involved creating a 5 minute <strong>PowerPoint presentation</strong>.  
            I had never used PowerPoint and felt a bit nervous. However, I was able to <strong>get 
                help</strong> because I knew how to search the internet for <strong>video tutorials</strong> about how to 
            use Microsoft PowerPoint. I also checked the university website and found that 
            there were introductory PowerPoint sessions available to students which <strong>really 
            helped me</strong>.</p> <p>If I could give you <strong>one tip</strong> in relation to creating presentations it 
                would be to check what <strong>help is available</strong> at your college before you begin and 
            keep your presentation simple.</p>
